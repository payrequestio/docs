# Understanding Payments

Payments are the core of the PayRequest platform. A payment represents a request for money from a customer, which can be fulfilled through various payment methods.

## Payment Lifecycle

Every payment in PayRequest goes through a predictable lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Created">
    A payment request is created with an amount, description, and optional recipient information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pending">
    The payment is waiting for the customer to complete the transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    The customer has initiated payment and it's being processed by the payment provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed">
    The payment has been successfully processed and funds are being transferred.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</CardGroup>

## Payment URLs

When you create a payment, PayRequest generates a unique payment URL that you can share with your customer:

```
https://payrequest.io/p/pay_1234567890
```

This URL provides a secure, hosted payment page where customers can complete their payment using their preferred method.

### Customizing Payment Pages

You can customize the payment page to match your brand:

- **Logo**: Upload your company logo
- **Colors**: Match your brand colors
- **Custom Domain**: Use your own domain (e.g., pay.yourcompany.com)
- **Success/Cancel URLs**: Redirect customers after payment

## Payment Metadata

Attach custom metadata to payments for internal tracking:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "order_id": "ORD-12345",
    "customer_segment": "premium",
    "source": "website"
  }
}
```

Metadata is returned in webhooks and API responses, making it easy to correlate payments with your internal systems.

## Expiration and Reminders

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Payment Expiration">
    Set an expiration date for payment requests:

    ```json
    {
      "expires_at": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    }
    ```

    Expired payments cannot be completed and will show an appropriate message to customers.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automatic Reminders">
    Configure automatic email reminders for pending payments:

    - **First reminder**: 3 days after creation
    - **Second reminder**: 7 days after creation
    - **Final reminder**: 1 day before expiration

    Reminders can be customized or disabled per payment.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Always validate payment completion through webhooks or API calls rather than relying solely on redirect URLs, as customers may close their browser before redirecting.
</Warning>

- **Webhook Verification**: Always verify webhook signatures
- **HTTPS Only**: Use HTTPS for all callback URLs
- **Idempotency**: Use idempotency keys for creating payments
- **Sensitive Data**: Never include sensitive information in metadata
