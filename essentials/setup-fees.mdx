# Setup Fees

Setup fees let you charge a one-time amount when a customer first purchases a product or starts a subscription. They help you
cover onboarding, installation, or activation costs while keeping recurring prices clear and predictable.

## Overview

Setup fees are separate from the regular subscription price or service fee. They are typically charged once at the start of a
customer relationship and then no longer appear on future billing cycles unless you manually add them again.

## What Are Setup Fees?

Setup fees can represent a wide range of one-time activities, including:

- **Account setup and configuration**
- **Installation services**
- **Onboarding and training**
- **Equipment deposits or security fees**
- **Activation costs**
- **Initial consultation fees**

## How Setup Fees Work

### 🔄 Subscription Products
- The setup fee is charged **once** when the subscription is created.
- Regular subscription billing continues on its own schedule.
- You can decide whether to charge the setup fee immediately or with the first billing cycle.

### 🛍️ Service Products
- The setup fee is added alongside the service price.
- Customers pay it as part of the initial order.
- The setup fee becomes part of the total order amount.

### 📦 One-time Products
- Use setup fees when a product requires installation or preparation.
- The fee is combined with the product price in a single transaction.

## Configuration

### Enabling Setup Fees

1. **Navigate to Product Management**
   - Go to **Dashboard → Products**.
   - Select an existing product or create a new one.
2. **Setup Fee Settings**
   - Toggle **Enable Setup Fee** to activate the feature.
   - Enter the setup fee amount (for example, €50.00 or €100.00).
   - Optionally customize the setup fee name and description.
3. **Charging Behavior for Subscriptions**
   - **Charge Immediately**: Bill the setup fee as soon as the subscription is created.
   - **Charge with First Cycle**: Add the setup fee to the first recurring invoice.

### Setup Fee Customization

You can tailor the wording that customers see so the fee makes sense for your business:

- **Custom Name**: Replace "Setup Fee" with terms like "Installation Fee", "Onboarding Cost", "Deposit", or "Borg".
- **Custom Description**: Explain what the fee covers, such as "One-time installation and configuration" or "Equipment deposit".
- **Multi-language Support**: Custom names and descriptions follow your translation settings. If you leave them blank, the system uses
the default "Setup Fee" text.

### Default Values

When no custom text is provided, customers see the default labels:

- **Name**: "Setup Fee" (English) / "Setupkosten" (Dutch)
- **Description**: "One-time setup fee for this service"
